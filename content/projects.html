    <h3><a href="http://github.com/bakineggs/okk/">Okk</a></h3>
    <p>
      I'm writing a programming language called Okk, which is designed primarily for writing programming languages. It's heavily based on <a href="http://fsl.cs.uiuc.edu/index.php/K">K Framework</a>.

    <h3><a href="http://github.com/bakineggs/challenge_okk/">Challenge Okk</a></h3>
    <p>
      Challenge is a language designed for testing the capabilities of language definition frameworks. I translated the <a href="http://fsl.cs.uiuc.edu/images/0/0c/CS422-Spring-2010-CHALLENGE.pdf">K semantic definition of Challenge</a> into Okk.

    <h3><a href="http://github.com/bakineggs/recurring_events_for/">recurring_events_for</a></h3>
    <p>
      recurring_events_for is a function written in PL/pgSQL (a procedural language for PostgreSQL).
      It is used to find the dates on which recurring events occur (for instance, an event that occurs on the second Tuesday of every month).
      It can also return all events occurring within a given timespan based on their repetition rules.

    <h3><a href="http://github.com/bakineggs/cars/">cars</a></h3>
    <p>
      Using PHP and JavaScript (with the <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> framework), I wrote a spreadsheet-like webapp that I used to collect data about different cars I was considering purchasing.
      The actual spreadsheet with the research I did is available <a href="/cars">here</a> (I ended up buying the Lincoln Continental).
